## Intro
Space Invaders is a University Project created by me in my 3rd year at Damascus University.

## Technologies
The game is built using Legacy OpenGL implemented using NEHE template.

## Controls:
#### Shoot: 'w'
#### Move Left: 'a'
#### Move Right: 'd'

## Setup
I advice you not to setup OpenGl on your computer and don't ever try to install itðŸ˜…, as it would take several days to do so.
